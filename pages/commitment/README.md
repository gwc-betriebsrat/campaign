## How to edit a commitment card

Each card looks like this:
```html
<div class="commitment-card">
  <div class="commitment-number">1</div>
  <div class="commitment-content">
    <h3>Commitment Title</h3>
    <p>Description text here...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
- The number is purely visual — don't change it unless reordering
- Edit the `<h3>` for the title and `<p>` for the description

There are **4 commitment cards** in total.

## How to edit a philosophy card

```html
<div class="philosophy-card">
  <h4>We are transparent</h4>
  <p>Description...</p>
</div>
```
Edit the `<h4>` title and `<p>` description directly.

```html
<ol class="beliefs-list">
